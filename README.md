# Mental-Health-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
We have built a Machine Learning model that can predict the presence of a mental illness in a person and suggest them options to approach a nearby doctor.
The model uses XGBoost and Random Forest Classifier as the two machine learning models and gives a good accuracy.
